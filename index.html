          <!-- <p>Dr. Harmeet Kaur is a senior data scientist with formal training in computational biology. 
            She likes taming messy data, connecting dots in them and build a complete picture or derive wisdom out of it. Experience encompass developing analytics pipeline, building predicitve machine learning models to communicate to relevant stakeholders through interactive dashboard. 
            I strive for working in a cross-functional environment building robust AI powered healthcare solutions impacting human life.</p>
           
            <p> Currently, she works at Johnson and Johnson Health and Wellness Inc, New Jersey, where she has leveraged LLMs to analyze clinical, insurance and behavioral determinants crucial in decision making for HCPs and patients in various therapeutic areas, recommending specific solution strategies.</p>
            <p> At Genentech, California, as part of a Dynamic team in Seth's lab, she contributed to designing of novel therapeutics through exploration of antibody-antigen interfaces </p>  
            <p> She also got an opportunity to work with Late Prof. John Westbrook at RCSB Protein Data Bank and was involved in developing APIs of molecular structural data from various resources to build a federated resource.As a health data science fellow at Insight, Boston, she formulated a machine learning based web application to predict gestational diabetes in expectant women to promote timely interventions.</p>
          <p> Prior to this, she led teams at Rutgers University, New Jersey, to extract, transform and load data retrieved through API to postgreSQL server deployed on AWS and built predictive model for risk stratification of CVD in human subjects. </p> 
          <p> One of my biggest achievements has been cracking three national fellowships (ICMR-JRF, CSIR-JRF, GATE) for pursuing doctorate. My PhD project focussed on understanding structural adaptation in antibodies of a lineage in response to different antigens. </p> 
             -->
          <p>Dr. Harmeet Kaur is a senior data scientist with a flair for transforming chaotic data into wisdom. Passionate about healthcare innovation, she currently harnesses LLMs at Johnson and Johnson to unlock critical factors influencing patient and provider decisions.

            Her journey includes designing novel therapeutics in Harris' lab at Genentech, California, where she explored antibody-antigen interactions, and creating APIs for a federated molecular resource with the late Prof. John Westbrook at RCSB Protein Data Bank. As a health data science fellow at Insight, Boston, she developed a machine learning app to predict gestational diabetes, driving timely interventions.
            
            With a strong foundation in computational biology, her PhD focused on how antibodies adapt structurally to various antigens. Dr. Kaur's achievements include prestigious fellowships from Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Council of Scientifc and Industrial Research (CSIR) and Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) that showcase her dedication to advancing healthcare solution through research and development.</p>
          
          <p>She is a team player who promotes experiential learning among peers, advocating for psychological safety in the workplace. For any queries and consultations, shoot her an email at meet.academia@gmail.com. </p>
